## About
Normally, you can't execute commands in hardcore mode. Not even if you explicitly want to! That's where this add-on comes in, allowing you to execute commands comfortably via a small detour!

# Execute commands
1. Open the menu (by sneaking and jumping at the same time, noding in spectator mode or by interacting with a stick)
2. Select `Run a new Command`
3. Enter your Command & Have fun!

> [!NOTE]
> Commands like `/gamemode` will run but don't do anything.
It's an limitation of Minecraft

## Intuitiveness
If you have a syntax misstage in your command, the addon will also display it in a littly ui

## History
Every command that's being execute will be sorted to your world, so you can run them again whenever you want.

# Multiplayer
By default, your friends don't have permission to prevent them turning your world to the next 2b2t server.
However, with the permission feature under settings, you can change this for each player individually, even for players who have long since gone offline.
